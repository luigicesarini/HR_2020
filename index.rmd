```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(leaflet)
library(leaflet.extras2)

m <- leaflet() %>%
  addProviderTiles(providers$OpenStreetMap) %>% 
  addMarkers(lng=9.154167, lat=45.185, popup="Where we would be in non-Covid times")  

```

#### Wrappers for some big data framework (e.g. Apache-Spark)  

Sparklyr is a tool used to handle large-scale data processing through the Apache-Spark framework

```{r, echo = TRUE, cache = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(sparklyr)
library(dplyr)

sc <- spark_connect(master = "local", version = 2.3)
iris_tbl <- copy_to(sc, iris,overwrite = TRUE)

iris_tbl %>% filter(Species == "setosa") %>% head()

```

#### Easy to work with databases (SQL's, Oracle, MongoDB and others)  

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(DBI)
# Create an ephemeral in-memory RSQLite database
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), ":memory:")

dbListTables(con)

dbWriteTable(con, "mtcars", mtcars)
dbListTables(con)

# You can fetch all results:
res <- dbSendQuery(con, "SELECT * FROM mtcars WHERE cyl = 4")
dbFetch(res)[1:3,]
```


---

### Basic syntax
**Arithmetic Operators**  
 `+` `-`  `*` `/`  
 `**/^`  
  `%%`  
 `NA`  
 `Inf`  `-Inf`
 `NaN`
 
**Logical Operator**  
* `&`,`&&` (and)
* `|`,`||` (or)
* `!`      (not)
* `==`
* `!=`
* `>=`,`<=`, `<`,`>`

**Assignment Operator**  
* `x = 5`
* `x <- 5`
* `5 -> x`

---

### Data types 

R language uses mainly five types of data  
  
* Logical: `TRUE` , `FALSE`  
* Numeric: integers `1` `5` and floating number `5.2`  
* Character: `'2'`, `Hello World`  
* Factor: `'1'` , `'String with level'`
* Complex: `i+4i`
  
Factors are used for categorical variables. They can be ordered or unordered  

Factors are stored as integers, and have labels associated with these unique integers.  

While factors look (and often behave) like character vectors, they are actually integers under the hood, and you need to be careful when treating them like strings


---

### Data structures 

Data types are usually stored into "container", usually called data structures  

These are the main data structures used in R:  
  
<br>  
* Vector  
<br>  

* Matrices and arrays  
<br>  

* Data frame and lists  

There are also data structures that are created when developing packages and tools that are used for a specific purpose. For example, tensors in TensorFlow.  

Several useful function to investigate nature of the data: 
 `class(),str(),dim(),as.vector(),mode(),length(), typeof(),attributes() `
 


---

#### Vector
Is the basic data structure in R and is made of element of the same type   `character`, `logical`, `integer` or `numeric`.  
You can create a vector in different way:  
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
#Empty vector with a specified length
vector()
vector("numeric",length=3)
#Vectors with specific content
x <- c(5,6,3.2)
print(x)
x <- c(1L,2L)
print(x)
```

---

#### Vector
  
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
# Logical vector
x <- c(TRUE,FALSE)
print(x)
#Character Vector
x <- c("Hello","World")
x
```
  
<br><br><br><br><br><br>  
Vectors tend to coerce the type of the data to the most convenient one. Pay attention!
---

#### Vector  
Vector as any kind of data structure can be investigated with several functions.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
length(x)
class(x)
str(x)
```
One may add element to an already existing vector or obtain a vector from a sequence of number  
```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- seq(0:10)
x <- 0:10

x <- c(15.2,x)
print(x)
```


---

#### Matrix

```{r}
mat <- matrix(ncol = 4,nrow = 4)
print(mat)
```

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#filled column-wise
m <- matrix(data = seq(1,24,2),nrow = 4,ncol = 3)
print(m)

typeof(m)
```

---

#### Matrix
```{r,echo=TRUE}
#By default the filling is by column, here try by row
n <- matrix(data = 1:2,nrow = 2,ncol = 3,byrow = TRUE)
print(n)
rbind(m,n)

cbind(t(m),t(n))
```



---

#### Indexing  
Selecting a subset of a structure.  
The index starts at 1 and does not exclude any value (i.e. the interval is open)  


**By position**
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='hide'}
x <- c("Hello","I'm","a PhD", "Student", "at Iuss", "in Pavia")

x[1]

x[-3]

x[2:4]

x[-(2:4)]

x[c(1,6)]  

x[0:-5]
```



---

#### Indexing  
**By Name**

```{r,echo=TRUE}
head(iris[,"Species"])
```

**By value (logical vector)**
```{r, echo=TRUE, results='asis'}
x <- c(-50,15,85,42,-61,14)

x[x == 15]
x[x < 0]
x[x %in%  seq(1,50,1)]
x[x %% 2 == 0]
```


---

#### Lists  

Lists allocate every mode of data, each element can be of a different type.  
List can be created in multiple way:  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
x <- list("Hi",15.2,TRUE,5)
x

```

---

#### Lists 

```{r,echo=TRUE}
#Initialize an empty list of length 3
x <- vector("list",length = 3)
x
```

```{r,echo=TRUE}

# List can have names for each element
x <- list(flowers=iris,numbers= rnorm(10,5,2),colors=c("red","yellow"))
names(x)
names(x)[2] <- "norm numbers"
```

---

#### Lists  

```{r}
head(x$flowers)
print(x[2:3])
```

List are helpful when writing functions. It allows you to return multiple object in a "tricky" way.

---

#### Data Frame  

It's the basic data structure for tabular data. Data frame is a rectangular list, all columns have the same length and as for the list they can host every kind of data.  

```{r,echo=TRUE}
df <- data.frame(initials = rep("LC",5), height=runif(5,min = 1.50,max = 2),weight=rnorm(5,mean = 70,sd = 5))

df

df$initials

df[['initials']]
```


---

#### Data Frame  
The indexing rules apply the same to dataframe structure

```{r,echo=TRUE}

df[,1]

df[3:5,2]

df[2,"height"]
```

---

#### Functions and Packages

**Built in functions**

```{r}
mean(c(5,6.75,18.2))  

```

**Built custom function**

```{r}
#Return the anomalies of a vector
anomalies <- function(x){
  anom <- x-mean(x)
  return(anom)
}

anomalies(c(7,8,15,32,56,41))
```

---

**Packages**  
```{r}
#install.packages("ggplot2")
library(ggplot2)           
ggplot(cars, aes(x=speed,y=dist))+geom_point()+theme_bw()
```


---

#### Control Statements
For loop is one of the control statements in R programming that executes a set of statements in a loop for a specific number of times, as per the vector provided to it.  
```{r, echo =TRUE, eval = FALSE}

for (variable in vector) {
  Something happen
}

```
A while loop is one of the control statements in R programming which executes a set of statements in a loop until the condition (the Boolean expression) evaluates to TRUE.  
```{r, echo =TRUE, eval = FALSE}

while (condition) {
  Something happen
}
```

---

#### Control Statements  
Consists of a Boolean expression (condition) and a set of statements (do something). If the condition is satisfied, the set of statements is executed otherwise the statements after the end of the `if` are executed  

```{r, echo =TRUE, eval = FALSE}

if (condition) {
  Do something
}else {
  Do something different
}
```

It is possible to write your own function, which is stored in R and can be _'called'_ in your scripts  
```{r, echo =TRUE, eval = FALSE}

function_name <- function(arguments){
  Do something special
  return(something special)
}
```


---

#### Example  
```{r,echo=TRUE}
i <- 0
while (i < 6) {
  print(i)
  i=i+1
}

if (i == 0) {
  my_name = "Luigi"
}else {
  print("I don't have a name")
}


```

---

#### Example cont'd

```{r}
head(mtcars)

cyl <- c()
for (j in 1:5) {
  cyl[j] <- mtcars[j,"cyl"]
}
print(cyl)
```


---

#### Reading data from external source  
There are a lot of type of data that can be read by R. The basic function to read a .csv or a .txt file are  
<br>
`read.table()`, `write.table()`    
`read.csv()`, `write.csv()`  
<br>
From the `data.table` package:
<br>
`fread()`  
<br>
Sometimes might be handy to save some variables  
<br>
`save(df, file='injury_data.RData')`  

`load(file='injury_data.RData')`


---

#### Packages: dplyr,sf,ggplot,tmap,raster


* `dplyr`  : is part of tidyverse and is used for data manipulation allows the use of the pipe operator 
<br><br><br>
* `ggplot2`: is also part of tidyverse is a system for creating graphic objects
<br><br><br>
* `sf`     : stands for simple features, a standardized way to encode spatial vector data
<br><br><br>
* `tmap`   : is a flexible tool used to create thematic maps
<br><br><br>
* `raster` : used to load and manipulate raster object
